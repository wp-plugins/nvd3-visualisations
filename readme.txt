NVD3 visualisations gives you tools to generate impressive business quality charts based on the famous NV3D visualisation library. 

== Description ==

NVD3 visualisations is a full set of visually interactive charts that can be controlled by simple options.

You can start to create any example chart into your blog and study it more before you decide if that suits for your visual presentation's needs at hand.

This product lets you generate as many copies of different charts on the one page as you wish and scale their size just the way you like case by case.

All the example's input data sets are stored in the same format on data folder so that you can easily copy them and start to use them as a template for your own data's needs.

This package is produced as an example how to bring in high level chart galleries into WordPress CMS and there is no active support available. 

If you like it give us some stars on WP plugin site so that others can find it more easily too

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it possible to have multiple charts on the same WP post or page? =

Good point & question !

YES indeed, the software is written so that it transparently creates and draws many charts on the same page and gives you exact control where you like to show them.

= How can I visualize my own data set? =

You just check at first the gallery's data folder's input file structure and then you can use any tool to create similar data sets on the server side. 

You may also want to write own function from which you directly call JavaScript API when data set is ready to show out.
